Here is a collection of matchers (for rspec) and steps (for Cucumber) for making testing emails a little easier.

These were originally written for the Story Runner and later translated over...  

This probably has a few rough edges.. any commits to smooth out the problems would be appreciated.


To use these in your features put the following in your env.rb:

require File.join(RAILS_ROOT, "vendor/plugins/email-spec/lib/email_spec_feature_setup.rb")
 * Make sure this require is after you require cucumber/rails/world.

The matchers and helpers should be available for your specs by default.
